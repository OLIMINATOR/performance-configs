# Server Performance Configs
Optimised configs aimed for big survival economy servers. That require handling a lot of players on a single server. But I highly recommend customising it for your needs using the guides listed below.  

There are only 1.17 configs for now.
## Guides Used
To optimise these configs, I used these guides:
* [YouHaveTrouble's Guide](https://github.com/YouHaveTrouble/minecraft-optimization)
* [Server Optimization Guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/)
* [Paper Chanâ€™s Little Guide](https://eternity.community/index.php/paper-optimization/)
* [Server Optimization Guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/guide-server-optimization%E2%9A%A1.283181/)
* [Anarchy Server Optimization](https://github.com/moom0o/AnarchyExploitFixes/wiki/Anarchy-Server-Optimization-Guide)
* [Top 10 Things You Missed Optimizing](https://blog.airplane.gg/10-things-you-missed-optimizing-survival-mc/) 
* [Shockbyte Reducing Lag](https://shockbyte.com/billing/knowledgebase/21/Reducing-Lag)
* [Purpur Documentation](https://purpur.pl3x.net/docs/Configuration/)

## Recommendations

### Stay away from these plugins
* **Stacker plugins** - stacking entities causes more lag because the server is than always trying to spawn new mobs. I would recommend stacker plugins only for stacking mobs from spawners and disabling their AI.
* **Item removal plugins** - these "free optimization" plugins are most of the time useless as you can "replace" them with item/alt item despawn rates in spigot.yml.

### Check your timings
Create a timings report, timings can give you a lot of helpful information about what is making your server lag ext.

You can use [BirdFlop's](https://www.birdflop.com/) @Discord bot on their [Discord guild](https://discord.com/invite/nmgtX5z) that you cand send the timings report to, it will tell you a few good ways to optimise your server.

### Useful Plugins
* [Insights](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/insights-super-configurable-region-limits-asynchronous-scans-1-17-x.56489/) - Allows you to set storage, redstone, items limits to regions, chunks or islands on skyblock/oneblock servers. 

* [AntiRedstoneClock](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/antiredstoneclock-worldguard-plotsquard-support-1-8-1-17.18557/) - Disables redstone clocks when your server TPS drops.

* [Spark](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/antiredstoneclock-worldguard-plotsquard-support-1-8-1-17.18557/) - Allows you to analyse your servers CPU and memory usage.

* [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) - Pre-generates chunks for better performance on survival servers.
